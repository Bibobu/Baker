# Baker
A baker map implementation in Rust for images

This is an implementation of the [baker's map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker%27s_map) algorithm on images. It creates a resized gif animation from
an input image, a randomly generated image or a splitted red/blue image.

It has no points beside that, really.

But tell me if you're interested.
